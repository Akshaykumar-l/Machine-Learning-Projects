# Space titanic Project

This Project is similar to Clasic Titanic survival project but this time its a space ship.<br>

Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, 
it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. 
Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transporAted to an alternate dimension!
To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, 
we are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system.
