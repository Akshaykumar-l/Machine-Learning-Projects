# Multiple Linear Regression

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. 
It's an incredible dataset for practicing Regression model and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, 
the challenges is to predict the final price of each home.

First of all this dataset made me realise for predicting price these are n number of factors influence in deciding.

This projects challenges in all areas of ML right from pre-processing , EDA, Feature selection,
Outlier handling, Model building and Iterating various paramenters.

after trying Linear regression, Ridge and Lasso regression , Random Forest and Boosting algorithm
it is the GradientBoosting which gives highest accuracy among all algorithms.
